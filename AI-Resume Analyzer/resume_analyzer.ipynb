This is exactly what an entry-level data analyst does.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Limited Core Data Skills:** The absence of SQL is a major oversight for a data role.\n",
      "2.  **Basic Python Application:** While Python is listed, there's no mention of its application in data analysis (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).\n",
      "3.  **Narrow Technical Stack for Data:** Only Power BI is listed as a dedicated data tool (besides Python). Modern data analysts often work with a broader set, including other visualization tools (e.g., Tableau), or more advanced data manipulation libraries.\n",
      "4.  **Lack of Version Control:** No mention of Git/GitHub, which is standard practice for showcasing code-based projects and collaboration.\n",
      "5.  **Limited Project Diversity (for AI/ML):** While the data analysis project is strong, for an AI/ML role, more projects demonstrating machine learning model building, deployment, or advanced AI concepts would be needed.\n",
      "6.  **Generic \"About\" Section:** While enthusiastic, it could be more focused on specific career aspirations (e.g., \"seeking an entry-level Data Analyst role to leverage analytical skills and contribute to data-driven decision-making\").\n",
